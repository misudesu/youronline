        <h1>Install Tailwind CSS with Create React App</h1>
        <p>Setting up Tailwind CSS in a Create React App project.</p>
        <h5>Note that for new React projects, we highly recommend using Vite, Next.js, Remix, or Parcel instead of Create React App. They provide an equivalent or better developer experience but with more flexibility, giving you more control over how Tailwind and PostCSS are configured.</h5>
